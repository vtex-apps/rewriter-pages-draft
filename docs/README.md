# Page Draft Feature

What problem is this solving?

From the perspective a user in the CMS, it is important to be able to create draft pages and work on them, while not making them published neither public. Therefore, this app makes sure only urls from the myvtex domain are available.

Whirlpool EMEA stores have several pages to upload that should only be at the draft level. Making them available publicly would not be necessary and would bring risks in terms of malicious access.

How should this be manually tested?

The app with this improvement is linked in the vtexspain account and miguelcarrera workspace.
For example this URL should not be available publicly, only when using myvtex domain.
