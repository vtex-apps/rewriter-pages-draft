# Page Draft Feature

**Disclaimer: this project is not maintained and is not supported by accounts with bindings.**

From the perspective a user in the CMS, it is important to be able to create draft pages and work on them, while not making them published neither public. Therefore, this app makes sure only urls from the myvtex domain are available. Making them available publicly would not be necessary and would bring risks in terms of malicious access.
